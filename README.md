[11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

### Add some Netlify helpers

Netlify Dev adds the ability to use Netlify redirects, proxies, and serverless functions.

```bash
# install the Netlify CLI in order to get netlify dev
npm install -g netlify-cli

# run a local server with some added Netlify sugar
netlify dev
```

## Code Quality

By default `CSS` and `JavaScript` is getting linted with every commit.

You can lint manually by running `npm run lint` and if errors occur you can try to fix them automatically by running `npm run format`.

With every pull request it is checked if the code can be build without errors and afterwards `CSS` and `JavaScript` is getting linted.

Additionally each page is audited by Lighthouse which can take some time. You can find the performance budget for this audit in the file `./budget.json`.
