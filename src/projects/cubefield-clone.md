## Recreating a Classic: Cubefield in Three.JS

Remember the days when flash games were all the rage? I certainly do. Taking a trip down memory lane led to my rendition of the classic game 'Cubefield', rebuilt with Three.js.

This was done back in 2017, so THREE.js may look a bit different today if you're looking at the code.

🎮 Play the game here: [Cubefield](https://christopher-hayes.github.io/cubefield/)
