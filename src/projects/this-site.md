### Frontend

#### 11ty

Chose [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) for its focus on static site generation - no bloat, just speed.

#### AlpineJS

Integrated AlpineJS to provide lightweight interactivity without slowing down the initial page load.

#### TailwindCSS

Used TailwindCSS to apply styles swiftly during development despite its size.

### Load speed

#### Fonts

Opted for Helvetica to avoid loading delays and maintain a classic look.

#### Navigation

Implemented subtle page-preloading to make internal navigation feel seamless.

### A deeper dive

I wrote a [blog post](/blog/site-update-2024) about the frontend tech choices in more detail.

I more recently wrote about [switching from Vercel to Hetzner + Coolify](/blog/hetzner-with-coolify).
