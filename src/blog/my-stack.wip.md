Some of the tools I use everyday.

## My Stack

### Financies

#### Tiller

For nearly 5 years now I've used [Tiller](https://www.tillerhq.com/) to manage my finances. It's a Google Sheets add-on that pulls in our accounts and transactions.

What I like about Tiller is you can just create a new sheet for some random finance info you want to keep track of and you can essentially have everything in one place. Versus a finance app + some google sheets.

While I like Tiller, the addon in Google Sheets is extremely slow. And accounts not connecting or refreshing is a constant issue. Most recently I had accounts disconnected for months at a time.

#### Actual Budget

In 2024, I've started using Actual Budget. I self-host it on my Hetzner server. Setting it up using Docker was quite easy.

Actual Budget has a SimpleFIN integration, so as someone who lives in the states, SimpleFIN allows me to automatically sync my banking data into Actual Budget. SimpleFIN is only $1.50 / month, so I'm pretty happy with it.

Actual Budget in general has been a good experience so far. It doesn't have a million features, but as a simple finance tool, it's perfect for my needs. So far, I'm finding that I prefer the fast and polished Actual Budget over the slow, but flexible Tiller.
