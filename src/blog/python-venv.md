`venv` is a module that comes with Python 3. It provides an easy way to create and manage virtual environments for different Python projects. Using virtual environments is a great way to keep your projects isolated from each other, and to ensure that everyone on a team is using the same version of Python and packages.

To create a virtual environment, you'll need to make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can then run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 -m venv <environment_name>
```

This will create a new virtual environment with the specified name. You can then activate the virtual environment using the following command:

```bash
source <environment_name>/bin/activate
```

Once the environment is activated, you can start installing packages as needed. When you're done working in the environment, you can deactivate it by running the following command:

```bash
deactivate
```

Using virtual environments is important because without it you can have dependency conflicts. It also makes it easier to switch between projects that use different versions of Python and packages.

Thanks for reading! üôå
