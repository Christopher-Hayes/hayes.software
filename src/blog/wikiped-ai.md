## ðŸ““ Reading Wikipedia in 2021

Wikipedia's default user interface (UI) can be plain and unappealing. Luckily, there are alternatives like Wikiwand that offer a more aesthetically pleasing experience. To find information, users can skim articles for relevant information or click on links to other articles. If Wikipedia does not have an article on a particular topic, users can turn to search engines like Google to find answers on other websites like Quora or specialized websites in the relevant field.

## ðŸ§  Reading Wikipedia in the Age of AI

The age of artificial intelligence (AI) has made reading Wikipedia even more convenient and accessible. For example, the popular AI-powered tool [WordTune](https://wordtune.com) now has an integration with Wikipedia that automatically creates summaries for each section of an article. This makes it easy for users to quickly understand the main points.

  x-data="{
    videoSrc: '/videos/bearlyai.webm',
    showVideoOverlay: function () {
      this.$dispatch('show-video-overlay', this.videoSrc);
      $refs.video.pause();
    },
    init: function () {
      // wait until the user has scrolled down to this element before loading the video
      const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
        if (entries[0].isIntersecting) {
          if (!$refs.video.src) {
            $refs.video.innerHTML = `<source src='${this.videoSrc}' type='video/${this.videoSrc.split('.').pop()}'>`;
            observer.disconnect();
          }
        }
      });
      observer.observe($refs.video);
    },
    }"
    @hide-video-overlay.window="$refs.video.play()"

    <button
    @click="showVideoOverlay()"
    class="h-52 md:h-96 w-full">

Additionally, the [Bearly.ai](https://bearly.ai) app allows users to ask any question they have using GPT-3, a powerful AI language model. With Bearly.ai, users can simply press a key to activate the app and quickly ask any question that comes to mind. This makes it perfect for clarifying confusing terms or gaining a better understanding of a topic.

Overall, AI has made reading Wikipedia even more efficient and user-friendly.

## ðŸ¤– Potential drawbacks of AI-powered tools and integrations

The integration of AI-powered tools and integrations like WordTune and Bearly.ai into the Wikipedia experience has both positive and negative effects on how people get their information. On the positive side, these tools make it easier and more efficient for users to find and understand information on Wikipedia. Summaries created by WordTune, for example, can help users quickly grasp the main points of an article, and Bearly.ai allows users to ask specific questions and receive answers from GPT-3 in real-time.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to relying on AI for information. One major issue is that GPT-3, like other language models, is not perfect and can sometimes generate incorrect or misleading information. This can be particularly problematic if the user is not aware that the information they are receiving is potentially unreliable.

For well-known and well-documented topics, the risk of receiving inaccurate information is lower. Overall, while AI can be a useful tool for accessing information on Wikipedia, it is essential for users to verify information from multiple sources to ensure accuracy.
