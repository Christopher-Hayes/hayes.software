## <span class="text-bg dark:text-fg inline-block py-1 px-2 bg-fg-dark bg-opacity-40 dark:bg-opacity-30 rounded-md font-bold">ubuntu 22.04</span>

- I've used Ubuntu since 16.04 and continue to use it due to its stability and wide software support.
- **Desktop**: GNOME

- **Terminal**: [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) <details><summary>Details</summary>
  - WezTerm is a GPU-accelerated cross-platform terminal written in Rust.
  - **Editor:** Vim
  - **[my dotfiles](https://github.com/christopher-hayes/dotfiles)** - Not exhaustive, Slowly moving my private dotfiles into this repo

</details>

- **Browser**: [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)<details><summary>Not Firefox?</summary>
  - I'm a huge fan of Mozilla, and a subscriber of [Mozilla VPN](https://vpn.mozilla.org/), [Relay](https://relay.firefox.com/), and [MDN Plus](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/MDN_plus). And previously only a Firefox user. But, between browser performance, Google Profiles, and better devtooling (responsive view, snippets, performance insights, local overrides), using Chrome as my main browser just made more sense.
  - However, if Chrome's Manifest V3 update arriving in 2023 completely breaks adblockers, def switching back to Firefox.

</details>

- **Editor**: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **Font**: [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) - Really nice ligatures.
- **Awesome Ubuntu Software**  <details><summary>Software</summary>
  - [Gnome Tweaks](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Tweaks) <details><summary>The place for missing GNOME configs</summary>
    - A common complaint with Gnome is it's lack of customization. Gnome Tweaks fills that gap for me.

    </details>

  - [GThumb](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gthumb) <details><summary>Fantastic GNOME photo viewer </summary>
    - I'm a huge fan of GThumb. It's an extremely capable photo viewer and editor with custom bash scripts support.
    - GThumb does have stability issues, but it's still by far the best photo viewer I've used.
    - I have some of my GHumb scripts shared on [GitHub](https://gist.github.com/christopher-hayes/fd1be7ee982726845e7d76f106d0cda8).

### Node: `nvm`

Using the `nvm` utility and `.nvmrc` files is a great way for developers to manage and switch between different versions of Node.js. nvm stands for Node Version Manager and is a tool used to switch between different versions of Node.js. A `.nvmrc` file is a simple text file that contains the version of Node.js to be used, and running nvm in the same directory as the `.nvmrc` file will automatically switch to that version. I talk more about how to use `nvm` in [this blog post](https://christopherhayes.dev/blog/nvm/).

### Python: `venv`

Python's `venv` module is a great way to manage virtual environments. A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated Python environments for them. This is a great way to avoid dependency conflicts and keep your system clean. I talk more about how to use `venv` in [this blog post](https://christopherhayes.dev/blog/python-venv/).
